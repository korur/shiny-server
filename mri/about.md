## About

R shiny allows users to dynamically interact with the data without the need to know the analytical code behind. This tool allows clinicians with the convenience of a browser to quicky analyze .nii file format, typical format for MRI images. 

The first mode allows images to be visualized as an animation. The second mode allows users to interactively visualize selected regions by clicking a point on any of the plots.

## Credits

The app uses, [Jon Clayden](https://twitter.com/jonclayden)'s [RNifti](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNifti/index.html) package to read in the data.
